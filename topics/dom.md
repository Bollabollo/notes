# Document Object Model
**DOM (Document Object Model)** is a programming interface for HTML and XML - an API that represents and allow interactions with HTML and XML. Defines the **logical structure** of a document and how the objects are accessed and manipulated.
The DOM describes HTML and XML elements as objects but **not describe objects in XML and HTML objects.**
## Structural isomorphism
If you create two DOM models to construct a model of the same document, they will have the same structure, objects and relationships.

## Parent and child element
Parents are simply element containers for the children elements within.
